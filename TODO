	added functionality so the "framework" can be partially used.

×	Find a better way of sending 403s natively [check headers on all libs] [use htacces ENV]
×	Files outside pub directory must not be accessible.
×	Document library::_content, and re order it. [move it to bottom]
×	Document library::option_set.
×	library::_class_get when 'parent' is used return 'Library' instead of calling class. (matching 'extends').
×	core::library() Add an extra option at core::config(), asking if they want to add an extra layer of 
					security by "parsing" the libraries before actually including them. using core::parse();
×	core::library()	Add the option to load several libraries at once, using an array of names.
×	core::parse()	use tmp file to know when the file was modified & only check syntax then.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.001 - These TODOs came from older frameworks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

×	Write a README file, describe framework's purpose.
×	Write a router class.
×	Write an error class. [with correct headers being sent]
×	Modify the way included libraries are organized. [check ideas]
×	Use XMLs for config handling [or maybe sqlite databases] ponder it. [check ideas]
