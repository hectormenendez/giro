--------
v0.0.002
--------

×	Find a better way of sending 403s natively [check headers on all libs] [use htacces ENV]

×	Files outside pub directory must not be accessible.

×	Document library::_content, and re order it. [move it to bottom]

×	Document library::option_set.

×	library::_class_get when 'parent' is used return 'Library' instead of calling class. (matching 'extends').

×	core::library() Add an extra option at core::config(), asking if they want to add an extra layer of 
					security by "parsing" the libraries before actually including them. using core::parse();

×	core::library()	Add the option to load several libraries at once, using an array of names.

×	core::parse()	use tmp file to know when the file was modified & only check syntax then.
