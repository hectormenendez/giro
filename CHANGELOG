v0.04r4 Application Handler; Autoloader Revised; CLI mode fix;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[29/SEP/2010]
-------------

CORE/application			Application Handler. This method will handle loading and instantiation of 
							Models and Controllers, added Controller overrider,So a Model can be shared for 
							more than one controller. [Useful for CLI standalone apps]

CORE/core::library			Autoloader Revised. Turns out the approach I used was an overkill, moved functio-
							nality to CORE/application.

index						CLI mode fix. error() was sending a header even in terminal mode. Disabled it by
							adding a conditional.

[25/SEP/2010]
-------------

CORE/core::library			Rewritten auto loader. Now tries to find libs in this order: APP > LIBS > CORE

CORE/library				Changed a misspelled constant.

-------------

/LIBS/db					DB Class bugfix. db::query was returning one result instead of all, turns out it 
							was because of a misspelled comparison operator. [= instead of ==]

/index						CLI Support updated. Improved script a wee bit and made sure only CORE is called
							when the framework is included.

/index						CLI Support enabled. The framework can now run from CLI; some minor PATH compat 
							issues were fixed; some support constants were added; 

/LIBS/db					Rudimentary SQLite2 support. This needs lots and lots of improvement. first alpha.

v0.03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[24/SEP/2010]
-------------

/index						Moved functionality back to index. Continuing with the last changes, I Moved those
/CORE/core					annoying classes [_error and _class] back to index.php. Added a TODO for them.
							Also the pseudo-constructor calling was moved back to index.

/index 						Moved simple routing fix. I've always assumed the framework would always be loaded
CORE/core::_construct		via a web browser, hence the use of html tags in error messages sent to the user; 
							turns out this was a mistake, since there are times it can be loaded from terminal
							or CRON [a recent application I made does this]; In order to maintain readability 
							and coherence, I moved the fix inside index.php.
							the CORE stays

/CODESTYLE					Added it to remember how to maintain a somewhat constant style when coding.

v0.02 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[22/SEP/2010]
-------------

/TODO & /CHANGELOG			Changed log format and version numbering.

/sys/core/core::library		Library folders support. The libraries can now be loaded from folders insde LIB,
							Allowing them to be in more than one file. A constant LIB_{CLASSNAME} is created
							holding the full path for that class.

/sys/core/core::_contruct	Simple routing. Core now expects a script named main.php inside the APP 
							directory, so the framework can be used [at least partially] from there.

»	Most basic functionality added. [tested on PHPv5.3]

»	Public folder will now be named 'PUB', instead of 'INC'

»	Using const DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR [renamed to SLASH] to hanlde slashes.
 
»	Simplified index.php core class will handle almost everything.

v0.01 Branch from Original Framework v0.688 Rev 10 (14/APR/09) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14/JUL/2010] 
-------------

»	Finally found the lost branch [cyf]. replacing [gik] with it.

»	Excluded the Error class [gik] since it wasn't even legible. [TODO added]

»	Changed the default line width from 90 to 110 cols. Updated comments accordingly.

»	I'm grabbing bits and pieces of h23 & gik, in order to have a minimal working FW and start this new	branch 
	code-named:giro.

»	Although this changelog says forked from v0.0.688, it should be v0.0.7 since I created	an unregistered  -
	branch [calling the project gik.mx] adding some new logic to the way everything works. [shame on me].
