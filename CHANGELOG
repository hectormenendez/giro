v0.0.001 [14/JUL/10] branch from v0.0.688 Rev 10 (14/APR/09) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
»	Finally found the lost branch [cyf]. replacing [gik] with it.

»	Excluded the Error class [gik] since it wasn't even legible. [TODO added]

»	Changed the default line width from 90 to 110 cols. Updated comments accordingly.

»	I'm grabbing bits and pieces of h23 & gik, in order to have a minimal working FW and start this new	branch 
	code-named:adast.

»	Although this changelog says forked from v0.0.688, it should be v0.0.7 since I created	an unregistered  -
	branch [calling the project gik.mx] adding some new logic to the way everything works. [shame on me].
