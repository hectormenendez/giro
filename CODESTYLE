-------------
*	Only index.php can have code in the global scope, everything else should reside inside a class.

*	If you are going to apply quick fixes the CORE, do it inside index.php.

*	All classes must be written assuming they will be loaded FROM index.php [CORE] and they must implement
	a mechanism to prevent any other behavior.
